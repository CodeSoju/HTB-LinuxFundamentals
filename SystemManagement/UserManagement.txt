USER Management:
---------------
USer Management is an essential part of Linux administration. Sometimes we need to  create new users or add other users to specific groups. 
Another possibility is to execute commands as a different user. After all, it is not too rare that users of only one specific group have the permsissions to view or edit specific files or dirs. This, in turn, allows us to collect 
more information locally on the machine, whcih can be very important. 

Execution as a user
    cat /etc/shadow
        cat: / etc/shadow: Permission denied 

Execution as root:
    sudo cat /etc/shadow
        root:<SNIP>:18395:0:99999:7:::
        daemon:*17737:0:99999:7:::
        bin:*17737:0:9999:7:::
        <SNIP>


sudo:  execute comand as a different user 
su:    The SU utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that 
        user ID(the default user is the superuser). A shell is then executed. 

useradd:  Creates a new user or update default new user information 
userdel:  Deletes a user account and related files 
usermod:  Modifies a user account 
addgroup: Adds a group to the system
delgroup:  Removes a group from the system 
passwd:   Change user password

Find:
    besides the function to find the files and folders, this tool also contains the function
    to filter the results. We can use filter parameters like the size of the file or the date. '
    We can alos specify if we only search for files or folders. 

Syntax:
    find <location> <options>

Ex:
    find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null

Let's go over the options above:

-type f   ==> we define the type of the searched object. 'f' stands for 'file'

-name *.conf   ==> with '-name', we indicate the name of the file we ar looking for.
                    '*' stands for 'all files' with the '.conf' extension

-user root   ==> this option filters all files whose owner is the root owner

-size +20k  ==> we can the filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are largers
                than 20KiB

-newermt 2020-03-03   ==>   with this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented

-exec ls -al {} \;   ==> This option executes the specified command, using curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backlash escapes
                        the next chapter from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would
                        terminate the command and not reach the redirection

2>/dev/null   ==> This is a STDERR redirection to the 'null device'. This redirection ensres that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must not be an option of the 'find' command.



LOCATE:
    it will take much time to search through the whole system for our files and directions to perform many different
    searches. The command locate offers us a quicker way to search through the system. 
    In contrast to the 'find' command, 'locate' works with a local database that contains all information about existing files and folders. We can update this 
    database with the following command:

        sudo updatedb
    
    If we now search for all files with the '*.conf' extension, you will find that this search produces results much faster than using 'find'

    locate *.conf

    output:
        /etc/GeoIP.conf
        /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
        /etc/UPower/UPower.conf
        ....
    
The downside of thie tool is that it doesn't have as many filter options that we can use.
